# üöÄ Multi-Architecture Docker Build and Deploy to Google Cloud Run

This repository demonstrates how to build **multi-architecture Docker images (AMD64 and ARM64)** using **Docker Buildx** and deploy them to **Google Cloud Run** (for AMD64 only). The ARM64 build intentionally fails during deployment to Cloud Run, as ARM64 is not supported by Cloud Run, to explore Docker multi-architecture builds for learning purposes.

## üåü Project Overview
This project focuses on:
1. Building Docker images for both **AMD64** and **ARM64** architectures using Docker Buildx.
2. Deploying the AMD64 image to **Google Cloud Run**.
3. Studying and understanding multi-architecture builds by intentionally deploying ARM64, which fails as **ARM64 is not supported in Google Cloud Run**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Google Cloud Run**: For serverless container hosting (AMD64 only).
- **Google Artifact Registry (GAR)**: To store Docker images.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD workflows.
- **Docker Buildx**: To build multi-platform Docker images.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
- **Input**: Source code is pushed to the `master` branch.
- **Pipeline Steps**:
  1. Authenticate with Google Cloud.
  2. Build architecture-specific Docker images (`AMD64` and `ARM64`).
  3. Push images to **Google Artifact Registry (GAR)**.
  4. Deploy **AMD64** image to **Google Cloud Run**.
  5. Attempt to deploy **ARM64** image to Cloud Run, which fails due to lack of support.

---

## üìã Workflow Setup

### **1. AMD64 Workflow**
The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-amd.yml`.

#### Steps:
1. Authenticate with Google Cloud using `google-github-actions/auth`.
2. Build an `AMD64` image using Docker Buildx.
3. Push the image to Google Artifact Registry.
4. Deploy the containerized application to Google Cloud Run for `AMD64`.

---

### **2. ARM64 Workflow**
The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy-arm.yml`.

#### Steps:
1. Authenticate with Google Cloud using `google-github-actions/auth`.
2. Build an `ARM64` image using Docker Buildx.
3. Push the image to Google Artifact Registry.
4. Attempt to deploy the containerized application to Cloud Run for `ARM64` (fails as ARM64 is unsupported).

---

## üéØ Learning Objective
This project is intentionally designed to:
1. Understand and implement multi-architecture Docker builds using Docker Buildx.
2. Explore the limitations of deployment platforms like Google Cloud Run (ARM64 is not supported).
3. Simulate real-world scenarios where architecture constraints may arise during deployment.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
1. **Google Cloud Project**: Make sure you have a project set up.
2. **Google Artifact Registry**:
   - Create separate repositories for AMD64 and ARM64.
   - Example repositories:
     - `amd64-repo`
     - `arm64-repo`
3. **GitHub Secrets**: Configure the required secrets in your repository settings.

---

## üîë Secrets Configuration

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
| Secret Name           | Description                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `GCP_CREDENTIALS`     | JSON key of your Google Cloud Service Account. |
| `GAR_REGION`          | Region of your Google Artifact Registry (e.g., `us-central1`). |
| `PROJECT_ID`          | Google Cloud Project ID.                       |
| `GCR_SERVICE_AMD`     | Cloud Run service name for `AMD64`.            |
| `GCR_SERVICE_ARM`     | Cloud Run service name for `ARM64`.            |
| `GAR_NAME_AMD`        | Docker image name for `AMD64`.                 |
| `GAR_NAME_ARM`        | Docker image name for `ARM64`.                 |
| `GAR_REPO_NAME_AMD`   | Artifact Registry repository for `AMD64`.      |
| `GAR_REPO_NAME_ARM`   | Artifact Registry repository for `ARM64`.      |
| `GCP_REGION`          | Deployment region for Cloud Run (e.g., `us-central1`). |

---

## üåê Deployment URLs
After successful deployment, the services can be accessed at:

| Architecture | Deployment Status   | Deployment URL                                               |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AMD64**    | Successful          | `https://<GCR_SERVICE_AMD>-<GCP_REGION>.a.run.app`          |
| **ARM64**    | Failed (Expected)   | N/A                                                         |

Replace `<GCR_SERVICE_AMD>` with the Cloud Run service name and `<GCP_REGION>` with the deployment region.

---

## üßπ Cleaning Up
To avoid unnecessary charges:
1. Delete the deployed AMD64 service from Google Cloud Run.
2. Remove both AMD64 and ARM64 images from Google Artifact Registry.
3. Delete unused Google Cloud resources.

## üìù Proof Of Work

Below are the Proofs that GCP doesnt supports the ARM64 architecture as of the repo published
